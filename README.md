Project Overview
Cat vs. Dog Classification using SVM
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset used is the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset, which contains labeled images of cats and dogs.

Objectives
Preprocess and extract features from images.
Train an SVM classifier to distinguish between cats and dogs.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Methodology
1Dataset Collection & Preprocessing
Download the Dogs vs. Cats dataset from Kaggle.
Resize images to a fixed size (e.g., 128x128 or 64x64).
Convert images to grayscale or use color channels (RGB).
Flatten images into feature vectors for SVM input.

2️Feature Extraction Approaches
Pixel-based Flattening – Convert images into a vector.
HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) – Extract texture features.
CNN Feature Extraction – Use a pretrained CNN (VGG16, ResNet) to extract high-level features for better classification.

3️Training the SVM Model
Use Scikit-Learn’s SVM classifier (e.g., SVC(kernel='linear' or 'rbf')).
Train on extracted features.
Perform Hyperparameter Tuning (C, gamma, kernel selection).

4️ Model Evaluation
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to measure performance.
Use a Confusion Matrix to visualize classification results.

5️ Deployment (Optional)
Convert the trained model to Flask or Streamlit for an interactive web app.
Allow users to upload an image and classify it as a cat or dog.

Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
Scikit-Learn (SVM implementation)
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
(Optional) TensorFlow/Keras for feature extraction

Expected Outcomes
A trained SVM classifier that can distinguish between cats and dogs.
Feature extraction using HOG, CNN, or pixel-based methods.
A deployed web app (if extended).

you can use tenserflow datasets also if this kaggle dataset dosent work
